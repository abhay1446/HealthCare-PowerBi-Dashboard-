# HealthCare-PowerBi-Dashboard-
Practice project on the Hospital data about Patient, Revenue, Other Factors.

*** Executive Summary: Hospital Patient Dashboard
*** Project Name : Hospital Analysis by PowerBI
*** This report analyzes key performance indicators (KPIs) for [Your Hospital Name] , a healthcare facility with a focus on both inpatient and outpatient care. The data, extracted from the hospital's Health Dashboard, provides insights into patient volume, bed occupancy, length of stay (LOS), emergency care efficiency, patient demographics, financials, feedback, and departmental performance.
### Key Findings:
'Balanced Patient Mix: The hospital serves a substantial patient population (2,506 total), with a near-even distribution between inpatients (1,679) and outpatients (827).
'High Bed Occupancy: A significant 1,751 beds are occupied, indicating efficient resource utilization.
'Efficient Patient Turnover: The average LOS of 1.70 days suggests effective patient flow management.
'Emergency Care Needs Attention: While the average ER time is reasonable (65.63 minutes), the average treatment time of 161.41 minutes points to potential bottlenecks in the emergency department.
Financial Stability: The hospital demonstrates financial health with a total revenue of $0.40 million.
Positive Patient Feedback: A considerable number of patients (0.6K) express positive feedback, highlighting the hospital's commitment to patient satisfaction.
Departmental Strengths: The "OT" (Operating Theater) department exhibits the highest inpatient volume, suggesting a potential area of specialization or high demand.
### Recommendations:
Streamline Emergency Care: Implement strategies to reduce ER treatment times, potentially through process improvements or resource allocation adjustments.
Optimize LOS: Conduct further analysis of LOS by age group and department to identify opportunities for reducing unnecessary stays.
Investigate OT Department: Explore the reasons behind the high inpatient volume in the OT department to ensure adequate resources and staffing.
Overall, the hospital demonstrates strong performance across various metrics. By addressing the identified areas for improvement, [Your Hospital Name] can further enhance its operational efficiency and patient care delivery.
Note: This is an educational purpose practice project.
